Write a function to return true if two strings are anagrams of each other, false otherwise.
Ignore whitespace and punctuation characters in the comparison.

Examples:
"face", "Cafe" -> True
"start", "stop" -> False
“aabbb”, “abbbb” -> False
“abc$”, “bac” -> True

To use program, run AnagramTest and supply the two requested strings. The program will output an answer in CLI.
